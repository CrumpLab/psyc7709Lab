  abstract = {Pearson'spaper of 1900 introducedwhat subsequentlybecame known as the chi-squaredtest of goodness of fit. The terminologyand allusions of 80 years ago create a barrierfor the modern reader,who findsthat the interpretationof Pearson'stest procedureand the assessmentof whathe achievedare less than straightforwardn,otwithstandingthe technicaladvancesmade sincethen. An attemptis made here to surmountthese difficultiesby exploringPearson'srelevantactivitiesduring the first decade of his statisticalcareer, and by describingthe work by his contemporariesand predecessorswhichseem to have influencedhis approachto the problem.Not all the questionsare answered,and others remainfor furtherstudy.},
